## DAO payroll management using money streams 🌊

## The problem it solves

Fluxpay greatly reduces the effort, overhead, and complexity when it comes to **DAO payroll management and execution** 😎

Now, DAOs can stream any token over time without any friction or fees to their team and contributors, settling their recurring compensation once and for all. 🤗

The benefits source from 4 key areas:

1. **Less effort**: streaming salaries allows DAOs to set a yearly (or monthly) amount to transfer and then moves the funds over time without the need for any further transactions on-chain. 🤑
2. **No more overhead**: you only have to set the amount of funds you want to transfer once, rather than every month. No more monthly admin and payroll transactions from complicated cold wallets. 🤩
3. **Reduced complexity**: you can stream to as many wallets as you want directly just by NFT collection address. 😁
4. **Pay in real-time**: contributors get paid in real-time and can use the funds as soon as they receive them using Superfluid 🌊.
